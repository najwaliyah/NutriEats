An application that combines technology services with nutrition consultations and monthly catering. NutriEats comes as a solution to meet the needs of a healthy diet and balanced nutrition in an increasingly busy modern era. NutriEats develops a platform that not only meets the nutritional needs of users through healthy catering, but also provides direct consultation to nutritionists. To achieve these goals, this project requires business process analysis by creating a system design diagram. By doing this, NutriEats succeeded in designing a system that suits user needs and is fit for purpose.

An application that combines technology services with nutritional consultations and monthly catering. NutriEats comes as a solution to meet the need for a healthy diet and balanced nutrition in an increasingly busy modern era. To achieve the objectives of this project, NutriEats is designed with a business process analysis approach that begins with a business narrative structure, which is processed into an Activity Diagram, Usecase Diagram, Domain Model, State Machine, CRUD Usecase, System Sequence Diagram. With this approach, NutriEats has succeeded in developing a platform that not only meets the nutritional needs of users through healthy catering, but also provides direct access to nutritionists. This comprehensive combination of services is expected to increase awareness of the importance of a healthy diet and encourage better eating habits among users.
